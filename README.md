# Github-Issues

This is an iOS App that retrieves open and closed issues of github repositories using Github API, with numerous new Swift and SwiftUI features, such as async/await, AsyncImage, gauges, etc.

### Features

- Built with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern to separate UI, data, and logic, making the code more maintainable and readable.
- Using asynchronous network calls (iOS 15+) (async await) to fetch and update data.
- Using gauges (iOS 16+) for an appealing visualization of information of issues
- Loading Users' avatar with AsyncImage (iOS 15+)
- Dark-mode compatible

### What I learned

- Further practices SwiftUI essentials (basic components, extracting reusable components, custom modifiers, etc.)
- Understanding some advanced features of Swift, including async/await, AsyncImage, Gauges, etc.
- Had a taste of handling real-world API calls with decoding fetched data
